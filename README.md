# Fullstack Development Challenge 8

## Welcome to the eighth Challenge of the UCLA Bootcamp!

In this challenge we were supposed to start from a scratch and make an SVG logo generator! To do this, we are using node.js to start an index.js file and have it generate a .SVG file that we can use as our new logo! To start, lets look at our requirements:

## User Story

```md
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
```

## The Completed Challenge

After completing the challenge, we should now have a working index.js file that will allow you to answer a series of questions now. From there, after completing these questions, you should be presented with a new .SVG file in your folder after you have downloaded this file.
